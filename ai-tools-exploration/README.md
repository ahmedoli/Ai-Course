## 🎥 Part A: Video Creation Process

### ✅ Tool Used:
- *Invideo AI* – [https://invideo.io](https://invideo.io)  
  An AI-powered text-to-video platform offering stock footage, animations, and voiceovers.

### 🛠 Steps Followed:
1. *Script Drafting*
   - Summarized key AI course topics: search algorithms (A*, Hill Climbing), logic inference, agent models, and AI games (Tic Tac Toe, Chess).
   - Structured the script as scenes: Introduction → Core Concepts → Algorithms → Games → Conclusion.

2. *Using InVideo AI*
   - Logged into [invideo.io](https://invideo.io).
   - Selected the *“AI Text-to-Video”* option and pasted the prepared script.
   - The platform automatically generated scenes using matching visuals and titles.

3. *Customization*
   - Chose an educational template style.
   - Added auto voiceover and background music.
   - Edited scene overlays to align with course content.

4. *Exporting*
   - Finalized and exported the video in .mp4 format.

## 🖥 Part B: Presentation Slide Creation

### ✅ Tool Used:
- *Gamma.app* – [https://gamma.app](https://gamma.app)  
  An AI-powered slide creator that turns outlines into professional presentations.

### 🛠 Steps Followed:
1. *Outline Planning*
   - Created a topic-wise outline covering:
     - Introduction to AI  
     - Agent Types  
     - Search Strategies (BFS, DFS, A*, AO*)  
     - Logic & CSPs  
     - Inference (Forward, Backward Chaining, Resolution)  
     - Game AI (Minimax, Alpha-Beta)  
     - Lab Projects

2. *Using Gamma*
   - Logged into [gamma.app](https://gamma.app).
   - Selected *“Start from Scratch with AI”* and input the outline.
   - Gamma generated slide content automatically with suggested visuals and design elements.

3. *Slide Refinement*
   - Customized slide titles, contents, and themes.
   - Enhanced visual clarity using Gamma’s built-in icons and layout tools.
   - Verified alignment with course topics.

4. *Exporting*
   - Exported final slides as a .pdf titled AI_Course_Presentation.pdf.
